Kian Khatiri
Full-Stack Developer | React, TypeScript & Python Focus | Building Practical AI Tools

I design and build full-stack applications using React, React Native, TypeScript, Python, Django, and Next.js. I focus on turning ideas into products that are useful, efficient, and easy to useâ€”especially when it comes to backend systems and automation tools. Recently, I've been building AI assistants and order management systems that help businesses streamline their daily operations.
