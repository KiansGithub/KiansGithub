# Kian Khairi  
**Full-Stack Developer | React, TypeScript & Python Focus | Building Practical AI Tools**

I design and build full-stack applications using **React**, **React Native**, **TypeScript**, **Python**, **Django**, and **Next.js**. I focus on turning ideas into products that are useful, efficient, and easy to use—especially when it comes to backend systems and automation tools. Recently, I've been building AI assistants and order management systems that help businesses streamline their daily operations.
